## Prosthesis
A prosthesis is a device designed to replace a missing part of the body or to make a part of the body work better. Diseased or missing eyes, arms, hands, legs, or joints are commonly replaced by prosthetic devices.
False teeth are known as dental prostheses. An artificial replacement of the jaw bone is called a maxillofacial prosthesis.


* Prosthetics not being a new field has already been explored
* Myoelectricity and implants
* Muscle Stretch Coefficient and grip
* Standards for precision and accuracy
* Strain-sensitivity curve to finger-grip pressure
* Miniature haptic devices for sensory feedback

We bring the use of Surface Mount Devices along with ML model to analyze the value from the sensors and make a prediction for the grip right away. 
As for the sensors we will be using EMG sensors, Temperature & Humidity Sensor, Piezoelectric sensor
